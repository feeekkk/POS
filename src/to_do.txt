yo add to this whenever you think of shit that needs done. The things that are on 
here right now should be done ASAP

Model (Sean)
* constructors for every model
* purchase
* return
* transaction
* After done that, wanna work on views or GUI with Tudor?

Controller (Feek)
* purchases
* returns
* transaction
* 

View (everyone)
* stop using TempView and write specific views

GUI (Tudor)
* text field and button for checking out items
* get started working on basic components each panel should have. IE tables or whatever
* make shit look not bad (this isn't ASAP)

GUI (everyone)
* a fuckton of stuff regarding starting the controllers and adding the views and everything

Database (Mike)
* Make tables. I would just make them based off the models that Sean writes so they
  match up

DAO (Mike)
* Start writing methods to interact with the DB. I set up a basic interface that each DAO could implement but up to you
  how you want to do it. doesnt matter

Server (everyone)
*
